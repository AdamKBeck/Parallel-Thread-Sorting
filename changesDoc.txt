I had to use a mutex semaphore for my printf() statements. 

I forgot that with my multiple threads, this would be an issue if I don't control the printf() flow.

I did not graph any solutions as I'm testing in 3 dimensions. 

Also, I did not run on the HPC as it involves restructuring my program to take in command line arguments from my .slurm file in a triple nested for loop. Instead, I accomplished this in my main method in C.
